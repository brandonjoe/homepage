General use:
This app was created to make a personal homepage for myself when I open my browser in the morning. It recieves weather, standard pacific time and date, upcoming holidays, articles that are related to tech, as well as a randomly generated quote. The background is from a daily random background api. The articles on the bottom are top tending articles related to tech from the NYTimes that I might be interested. 

The city's weather can be changed and updated (with the enter key), but it won't save it on refresh. 

Future plans for users:
As of right now, the site is tailored to me. I plan in the future to set up a node/mongo backend to create profiles for other users so they can save their weather and add different sections of artciles other than "technology." The problem is how to store data and save it on the cache of the browser so that the user doesn't need to log in every time. 

Future plans for app:
I also want the search function for the weather to be more loose. As of right now, it needs have an exact name and any errors aren't corrected for. I also want to make sure that zipcodes work too. I should shortly include a download button to the daily background in case anyone wants to download a full resolution image without dabbling with the developer tools.
