# Homepage

This app was created to make a personal homepage for myself when I open my browser in the morning. It recieves weather, standard pacific time and date, upcoming holidays, articles that are related to tech, as well as a randomly generated quote. The background is from a daily random background api. The articles on the bottom are top tending articles related to tech from the NYTimes that I might be interested. 

### General use

There isn't a lot of user interation with this. The only use at the moment is putting in a city name for new weather. Use the "enter" key after putting in a city name. It also won't save on refresh. 

### Future use 

As of right now, the site is tailored to me. I plan in the future to set up a node/mongo backend to create profiles for other users so they can save their weather and add different sections of artciles other than "technology." The problem is how to store data and save it on the cache of the browser so that the user doesn't need to log in every time.
